I worked at Intel as a RAS Application Engineer - Graduate Intern from May 2024 - December 2024 which gave a great expoure on RAS (Reliability, Availability, Serviceability) Features used by the datacenter servers in order to minimize the downtime of the systems and provide a reliable system operation during the time of fault/failure due to errors in the system.
